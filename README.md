# Project-2

It is a social network, where people can share recipes.

I will start off with some example recipes as a start. 

It should look sth. like this: https://www.hellofresh.de/recipes/

I will have two data models for the database:
- recipes (title, fotos, ratings, ingredients, directions, labels, comments (User-ID) )
- users (username, password, recipes-ID, favourites)

# Pages

    Signup/Login
There will be a signup page with E-Mail/Password Signup and a Social Facebook Signup.

    Recipe - Overview Page
I will have an overview of all the recipes which are already put into the database.
The overview should have a search function. 
Label-Filter 

    Recipe - Input Page
There should be a template for the recipe-data entry.

    Recipe - Detail Page
You are allowed to edit any recipe. It should show the last changes on the recipe and the author of the recipe.
The detail page should have a comment function.
It could look sth. like that:
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/279340/grilled-salmon-with-maple-syrup-and-soy-sauce/?internalSource=rotd&referringContentType=Homepage


    Login-Favourite-Recipe
You can save recipes as your favourites. 

Extras maybe:
- Users could be following other users or being followers.
- Picture-Reader - Users don't need to type anything.
- Translate the site into German ?
